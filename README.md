Lands - a world generator
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ftomassetti/lands.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ftomassetti/lands)

You can generate worlds data (heighmap, biome, etc.) and images for your own worlds.

For example:

```bash
# before using lands: if you plan to change the code
python setup.py develop 

# before using lands: if you want just to install lands
# on unix-ish system you could have to prepend sudo
python setup.py install

# Lands 0.5.1 or next
lands world -s 1 -n seed1

# Lands 0.5.0 or previous
python lands/generator.py world -s 1 -n seed1
```

Worlds are generated using plate simulations, erosion, rain shadows, Holdridge life zones model and plenty of other phenomenons.

Once a world it can be used for simulation civs evolution (see project [civs](https://github.com/ftomassetti/civs)).

For a generated world is also possible to generate additional maps, for example ancient looking map:

```bash
# Lands 0.5.1 or next
lands ancient_map -w seed1.world

# Lands 0.5.0 or previous
python lands/generator.py ancient_map -w seed1.world
```

Gui
===

Since version 0.5.0 an experimental (and limited!) GUI is available. 

```
landsgui
```

Note: it requires to install QT (available here [http://qt-project.org/](http://qt-project.org/))

Install
=======

### _On Windows_

Executable file is available under [releases](https://github.com/ftomassetti/lands/releases)

Note: you need also a copy of the lands src directory in the same folder as the exe.

If you want to build Lands on Windows you can read these [instructions](https://github.com/ftomassetti/lands/wiki/Lands-on-Windows).

Note: the problem could crash after generating the files, it is a known problem but you should have anyway your nice maps generated! We are working on a fix for that

### _On Linux or Mac_

1. Install python 2.7
2. Install pip
3. Git clone / download the repository
4. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Install Tk (on ubuntu ```sudo apt install python-tk python-imaging-tk```)
6. You should be good to go!

Output
======

The program produces a binary format with all the data of the generated world and a set of images. For examples seed 1 produces.

Usage
=====

| Short | Long | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| -o    | --output | generate files in OUTPUT |
| -n    | --worldname | set WORLDNAME |
| -b    | --protocol-buffer | save world using protocol buffer format (smaller file) |
| -s    | --seed | use SEED to initialize the pseudo-random generation |
| -t    | --step | use STEP to specify how far to proceed in the world generation process |
| -x    | --width | WIDTH of the world to be generated |
| -y    | --height | HEIGHT of the world to be generated |
| -w    | --worldfile | WORLD_FILE to be loaded (for ancient_map operation) |
| -g    | --generatedfile | name of the GENERATED_FILE (for ancient_map operation) |
| -f    | --resize-factor | resize factor |
| -p    | --plates-resolution | plates resolution |
| -q    | --number-of-plates | number of plates |
| --gs  | --grayscale-heightmap | produce a grayscale heightmap, after the option it expects the name of the file where to generate the heightmap (e.g., --gs bw.png) |
| -r    | --rivers | produce a map of reivers, after the option it expects the name of the file where to generate the map (e.g., -r rivers.png) |

For example these commands:

```python
python lands/generator.py world -s 4 -n an_example -p 2048 -q 25 -x 2048 -y 2048
```

Produce this output

Algorithm
=========

The world generation algorithm goes through different phases:
* plates simulation: it is the best way to get proper mountain chains. For this [pyplatec](https://github.com/ftomassetti/pyplatec) is used
* noise techniques are used at different steps
* precipitations are calculated considering latitude and rain shadow effects
* erosion is calculated
* humidity in each zone is calculated
* terrain permeability is calculated
* biome is calculated using the [Holdridge life zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdridge_life_zones) model

Install dependencies
====================

Using virtualenv you can install the dependencies in this way

Python 2:
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate    
pip install -r requirements2.txt
```

Python 3:
```bash
pyvenv venv3
source venv3/bin/activate    
pip3 install -r requirements3.txt
```

Contributors
============

All contributions, questions, ideas are more than welcome!
Feel free to open an issue or drop me an e-mail.

I would like to thank you great people who helped me while working on Lands:

* [Evan Sampson](https://github.com/esampson) contributed the amazing implementation of the Holdridge life zones model and improved a lot the ancient-looking-map, biome, precipitation and temperature generators. Thanks a million!

* [Ryan](https://github.com/SourceRyan) contributed the Windows binary version and discussed Lands on Reddit bringing a lot of users. Thanks a million!

* [stefan-feltmann](https://github.com/stefan-feltmann) made Lands depends on pillow instead that on PIL (which is deprecated). This could also help when moving to Python 3. Thanks a million!
